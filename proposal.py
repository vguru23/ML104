    People's physical capabilities change over time, which can be challenging for those with disabilities or chronic conditions. 
    Therefore, a dynamic smart bathroom environment can be beneficial for health monitoring and diagnosing[1]. 
    In addition, monitoring physical activity with sensors and force readings can help create tailored treatments quickly and in real time[2]. 
    A smart bathroom environment can also be used for documenting physical data and identifying behavioral changes[3]. 
    The goal of our research is to develop a machine learning model that classifies movement as a person sits on the toilet into three classes: 
    sitting, offboarding, and onboarding to identify movement patterns in adults with physical impairments.

with st.expander("Dataset Description"):
    st.write("""
    Our dataset consists of force sensor readings from 40 people with 20 trials each. Some key features include:
    - Timestamps (Unix format): These represent the exact time when the sensor data was captured.
    - Load sensor values: These are readings from several sensors scattered around the toilet seat. 
      These numbers will be useful in determining the Center of Pressure (COP).

    The purpose of this research is to detect unexpected behaviors such as abnormal sitting or rising patterns in participants with physical disabilities. 
    This technology can be integrated into alarm systems that alert family members or caretakers in the event of a fall or prolonged sitting. 
    In addition, this technology can help monitor changes in movement patterns of those with disabilities to monitor long term health.

    The project goal would be to have overall high precision and accuracy which therefore leads to a high F1 score. 
    A high recall is also important because of the need to minimize the number of false negatives in a medical setting. 
    One ethical consideration is if the model is wrong and does not find when a participant is struggling with their movement patterns. 
    Conversely, the model could wrongly identify patients with abnormal movement patterns. 
    For expected results, the model should be able to classify a time range in which a participant is getting on/off the toilet seat.

        Unncessary colums were removed from the data, leaving only the timestamps as well as the four sensor values. 
        Outliers that were outside the normal range were removed, as well as any invalid sensor reading. 
        The filtered data was then compiled into a single CSV file. The next step was to calculate the center of pressure 
        for the sensor readings in regards to the X and Y axis. These features will be considered COP_X and COP_Y. This was done by 
        adding up all sensor readings based on the physical layout of the sensors, and dividing it by the sum all 4 sensor readings for 
        that particular datapoint. Timestamps with missing data/data outside the normal range were removed. Data was labeled based 
        on the various categories with not being on the seat was considered the default state.

    The hyperparameters specified for the model include estimators at 200, a random_state at 42 (arbitrary randomness metric), and class_weights to have balanced results(higher importance for certain movements). 
    While Training the model, we used 80% 
    of the data for training, while the rest was used as testing data.
